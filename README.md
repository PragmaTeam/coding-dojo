> Our goal is to learn, teach and improve our technical practices and

A Coding Dojo is a programming session based around a simple coding challenge.
Programmers of different skill levels are invited to engage in deliberate
practice as equals.

The premise of a Coding Dojo is to promote continuous learning in a safe
enfironment. It is both non-competitive and inclusive. People of different skill
levels collaborate together, encouraging each other to talk onpenly about design
and techniques.

We believe that Coding Dojo represents a different challenge to developers. It
encourages them to speak to an audience about their code, which is a different
skill to producing it. These skills are developed during a Dojo as it simulates
social and self organisational skills. It makes people become more rounded
software engineers and discover potential areas of improvement.

books have U read? Am I thinner? How many self-organization books? I can't even
find them all."_ - [Ron Jeffries](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/jatpractice/)
