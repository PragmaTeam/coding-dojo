## Kata: WarriorJS

### Description:

This is a game designed to teach JavaScript and artificial intelligence in a fun, interactive way.

You play as a warrior climbing a tall tower to `[insert something motivating here]` at the top level. On each floor, you need to write JavaScript to instruct the warrior to battle enemies, rescue captives, and reach the stairs.
